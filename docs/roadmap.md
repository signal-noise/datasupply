# Roadmap

As of right now the project is in the early design stage, and there is no code available. We'll developing it in the open though, so check back.

## How it starts

The first release of Data Supply will have modest aims.

It will be compatible with Next.JS, consume static CSV data, contain basic filters and present data to custom-built React components.

It will be built using Typescript and published with a permissive OSS licence using NPM.

## How it continues

Dynamic data sources such as APIs will be high on the list of early features.

Commonly used, full featured charts are likely to be added as UI components before long.

Specific server side code, for example connecting to a DB or ORM is considered for a future release.
