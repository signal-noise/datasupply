# Uniform documentation

> Uniform is an opinionated data processing, provision and presentation library of components for Javascript

> !! This document (and most of the content of this folder) is placeholder, here to give some structure. It needs updating once code is written to support it.

## Functionality

How does it work?

## Getting started

Please read the [Getting started](./getting_started.md) page for a simple example.

## Usage

Summary goes here, but also go take a look at the [Configuration](./configuration.md) page.

## Opinions

When we say opinionated, what does that mean, specifically? is it just the defaults that are applied? (that will be in config), or is there more to it?
