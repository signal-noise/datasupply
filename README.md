# Unified Orchestrated Resource Management

> UnifORM is an opinionated data processing, provision and presentation library of components for Javascript

Using uniform will allow you to easily rely on conventions to access data at the component level, having supplied it in a CSV or JSON file, without having to create boilerplate to ingest, store, filter and make the data available by hand.
